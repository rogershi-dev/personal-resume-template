cd personal-resume-template

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server

```

# Usage
- Once you started the development server, you should now be able to access the resume from `http://localhost:3000`.Then navigate to `App.js` to switch positions of different sections.
- You can also edit individual components for your preferred customization.You can even create your own components and add them to the resume.
- Remember, you don't directly send the project to your hiring manager for your job application.Instead, you can print out the current page as PDF using the browser's `Print` functionality.This ensures that the resume details are neatly formatted and easily accessible.
- One last thing, based on your personal preference, you may choose whether to include `Headers and footers` or `Background graphics` in the resulting PDF.
